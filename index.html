            Alfa Slab One is a contemporary take on the Six-lines Pica Egyptian created 
            by Robert Thorne for the Thorowgood Foundry in 1921. Although initially based 
            on that model, Alfa Slab One was designed with an extreme stem weight, big 
            serifs, more stem contrast and gradual terminals with a single serif. All 
            this attributes give Alfa Slab One a contemporary look with extreme black 
            density.

            Roboto has a dual nature. It has a mechanical skeleton and the forms are 
            largely geometric. At the same time, the font features friendly and open 
            curves. While some grotesks distort their letterforms to force a rigid rhythm, 
            Roboto doesn’t compromise, allowing letters to be settled into their natural
             width. This makes for a more natural reading rhythm more commonly found 
             in humanist and serif types.

            Bebas Neue is a display family suitable for headlines, captions,
             and packaging, designed by Ryoichi Tsunekawa. It's based on the 
             original Bebas typeface. The family is suitable for pro users 
             due to its extended character set and OpenType features.

            Open Sans is a humanist sans serif typeface designed by Steve 
            Matteson, Type Director of Ascender Corp. This version contains 
            the complete 897 character set, which includes the standard ISO 
            Latin 1, Latin CE, Greek and Cyrillic character sets. Open Sans 
            was designed with an upright stress, open forms and a neutral, 
            yet friendly appearance. It was optimized for print, web, and 
            mobile interfaces, and has excellent legibility characteristics 
            in its letterforms.

            Arvo is a geometric slab-serif typeface family suited for screen and
            print. The family includes 4 cuts: Roman, Italic, Roman Bold, Bold
            Italic. It is a libre font, first published in Google Fonts. The
            flavour of the font is rather mixed. It's monolinear-ish, but has a
            tiny bit of contrast (which increases the legibility a little in Mac
            OS X.)

            Lato is a sans serif typeface family started in the summer of 2010
            by Warsaw-based designer Łukasz Dziedzic (“Lato” means “Summer” in
            Polish). In December 2010 the Lato family was published under the
            Open Font License by his foundry tyPoland, with support from Google.
