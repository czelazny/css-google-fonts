            Alfa Slab One is a contemporary take on the Six-lines Pica Egyptian created 
            by Robert Thorne for the Thorowgood Foundry in 1921. Although initially based 
            on that model, Alfa Slab One was designed with an extreme stem weight, big 
            serifs, more stem contrast and gradual terminals with a single serif. All 
            this attributes give Alfa Slab One a contemporary look with extreme black 
            density.

            Roboto has a dual nature. It has a mechanical skeleton and the forms are 
            largely geometric. At the same time, the font features friendly and open 
            curves. While some grotesks distort their letterforms to force a rigid rhythm, 
            Roboto doesnâ€™t compromise, allowing letters to be settled into their natural
             width. This makes for a more natural reading rhythm more commonly found 
             in humanist and serif types.

            Bebas Neue is a display family suitable for headlines, captions,
             and packaging, designed by Ryoichi Tsunekawa. It's based on the 
             original Bebas typeface. The family is suitable for pro users 
             due to its extended character set and OpenType features.

            Open Sans is a humanist sans serif typeface designed by Steve 
            Matteson, Type Director of Ascender Corp. This version contains 
            the complete 897 character set, which includes the standard ISO 
            Latin 1, Latin CE, Greek and Cyrillic character sets. Open Sans 
            was designed with an upright stress, open forms and a neutral, 
            yet friendly appearance. It was optimized for print, web, and 
            mobile interfaces, and has excellent legibility characteristics 
            in its letterforms.

            Imprima looks excellent even on cheap home printers because 
            it has broad counters, strong joins between stems and inktraps 
            that enable it to perform well in very small sizes. 
            Professionally printed documents will make it look even better, 
            especially in large sizes, because there the details of its 
            design that are distinctive become clearly visible. The 
            design of this typeface family is cared for as one cares 
            for your own family. Each component has been treated humanely, 
            by hand.
